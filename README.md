# Steam... Get on top!

## SUMMARY
	
This is a suite of PowerShell scripts to get on top of the burden of managing an unwieldy Steam library. Presently, it consists of:
- SteamTools module: Adds some functions to work with steam *.acf and *.vdf Valve data files, and to help work with steam API calls.
- Publish-SteamAppManifests: Scans install folders in <steam>\SteamApps\Common and creates missing App Manifests. Greatly simplifies library migration/recovery!
- Set-FamilySharingPrecedence: Allows you to set the order of precedence for library sharing. The Steam client only recognises a single lender (even if multiple users are sharing the same game with you) so this gives some control over precedence, otherwise it is determined chronologically according to who set up library sharing first.

## REQUIREMENTS

- Powershell 3.0
- .NET Framework
- Steam
- Internet connection (to grab AppIDs and Names directly from Steam)

## USAGE GUIDE

###	Publish-SteamAppManifests

####	Getting Started
	
- Copy the files and subfolders in this directory to a sensible location on your local computer. For the sake of this guide, let's copy to 'C:\Scripts\Steam-GetOnTop'.
- Run PowerShell
- Set the location to where ever you copied the files. eg: Set-Location "C:\Scripts\Steam-GetOnTop" (cd "C:\Scripts\Steam-GetOnTop" will work too)
- Exit Steam
- Run .\Publish-SteamAppManifests.ps1 (Run Get-Help .\Publish-SteamAppManifests.ps1 for details on command line parameters)
- Watch the logging text scroll by
- When the 'Sanity Check' window pops up, look through each row and confirm that a sensible match has been made:
	+ Ensure the 'Valid?' checkbox is ticked for each app you'd like to create a manifest for
	+ Uncheck the 'Valid?' checkbox for anything you don't want a manifest for - install directories remain after an app has been uninstalled, and some matches may not be quite accurate
	+ AppID and Name columns are editable and will validate against Steam - if a false match is made, you can readily correct this
- If you're happy, click "Build ACFs"
- Restart Steam, and it will now validate all new app manifests. This may take some time, but it will run in the background (go to Steam -> Library -> Downloads to see the validation queue)

####	How It Works
	
- Check registry for Steam root path
- Check <steam root>\config\config.vdf for additional libraries
- Download a complete list of Steam apps from http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/GetAppList/v0001/
- Build a lookup table that contains info about the installed games by reading all the *.acf files in each library folder
- Get local steam users from <steam root>\userdata
- Get a full list of that user's games from http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/<userID>/games?tab=all&xml=1 (by default the script will only match against your owned games)
- For each install directory in <each library>\SteamApps\Common\:
	+ Try to match against lookup table (fastest, most accurate)
	+ Try to find app named identically to the install directory name (fast, accurate)
	+ Try a regex match of the install directory name (prone to finding multiple results, for instance "Game Title" may match "Game Title", "Game Title Trailer", "Game Title Demo", etc)
	+ Try a regex match with each word in the install directory name (space delimited) (more robust than above, but less accurate)
	+ Try a regex match with each word in the install directory name where no spaces are present (for instance "ThisSteamGame" will try to match "This" and "Steam" and "Game")
	+ Try a regex match with each word in the install directory name (underscore delimited)
- With the data scraped by the queries above a table will be populated, and any unmatched install directories will be tacked on for manual intevention
- User is presented with a "Sanity Check" window that tabulates all results.
- User can mark each row as valid or not, and add/edit AppIDs and Names for bad matches or unmatched directories
- With the user's consent, app manifests will be created in the appropriate location
	+ App manifests are created with only an AppID, Name, InstallDir and a StateFlag of 2 (StateUpdateRequired). This is essentially the same as clicking "Install" in the Steam client. - Steam will populate all other data, and check for existing files.
- Authoritative matches (where an ACF exists already) are added to the lookup table 

###	Set-FamilySharingPrecedence

####	Getting Started

- Copy the files and subfolders in this directory to a sensible location on your local computer. For the sake of this guide, let's copy to 'C:\Scripts\Steam-GetOnTop'.
- Run PowerShell
- Set the location to where ever you copied the files. eg: Set-Location "C:\Scripts\Steam-GetOnTop" (cd "C:\Scripts\Steam-GetOnTop" will work too)
- Exit Steam
- Run .\Set-FamilySharingPrecedence.ps1
- Order the list by dragging and dropping. It is recommended to set less frequent users toward the top of the list.
- Click accept changes

####	How It Works
	
- Check registry for Steam root path
- Get InstallConfigStore->AuthorizedDevice from <Steam root>\config\config.vdf
- Match against usernames/personae in <Steam root>\config\loginusers.vdf
- Create a sortable table and present it to the user
- If the user accepts the changes, <Steam root>\config\config.vdf is backed up and overwritten with a file containing the new order for InstallConfigStore->AuthorizedDevice
